# NIH_scripts
A collection of perl scripts for NGS analysis


## things to put in this readme
- Add note to credit the wonderful people at the NIH who wrote these scripts
- Brief description of all the files in this repository - *what do you think we works here? A list of the commands, what they're used for, and maybe quick usage info?*


### notes (BJM)
- most of the scripts had a readme text and/or Word file in its O2 folder. I've just migrated these over into README markdown files. Some of these are pretty simple (and for simple scripts) but seemed helpul to include this documentation.
- Q: regrading bowtie2stdbedGraph script documentation. It seems like this is an update to a previous bowtie2bedGraph script? The Word document ("bowtie2stdbedgraph.doc") seems to detail the old script, but the readme txt file ("bowtie2stdBedGraph_readme.txt") detailed the updates made in the new one. I've stitched these together into the README.md file, so I think this now covers all the options in the sciprt... but please check this readme carefully. Also, the documentation noted the chromosome length files, so I've left those in the folder.
- I made gitignore file because my MAC kept creating .DS_Store files and then pushes these to the repository (I did most of this locally). Once I've finished what I need to do on my MAC I can remove the gitignore file.
